Description: This function provides you with a summary of your time and unit

	of missing data. Examples of such analysis include standard regression 
	analysis and most implementations of maximum likelihood. By default 
	provides a data frame of unit and time coverage ("coverage.df"), can 
	also additionally supply a latex table or a visualization of coverage. 
	Supports 3-dimensional data by providing total number of observations in 
	tables, and "heatmap" of observations in visual.
